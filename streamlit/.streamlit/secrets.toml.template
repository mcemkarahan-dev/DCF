# Streamlit Secrets Configuration
# 
# For local development, create a file called 'secrets.toml' in the .streamlit/ directory
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment, add these in the app settings under "Secrets"
#
# DO NOT commit secrets.toml to git! It's in .gitignore for safety.

# Example format:
# ROIC_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
